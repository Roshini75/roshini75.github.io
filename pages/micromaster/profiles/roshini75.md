I'm passionate about learning the latest technologies related to both frontend and backend. I really enjoy creating responsive and user-friendly applications. I would like to work in fast-paced environments with high educational and cultural diversity. I have two years of experience in both frontend and backend technologies. I am a pragmatic thinker and have a great predilection towards problem-solving. I'm an adaptable and self-motivated learner. Interested in new programming technologies and continuous self-improvement. I'm currently open to internship opportunities for fall 2020 within the software engineering discipline.
